# YASD - Yet Another Security Dashboard
YASD serves as a user-friendly frontend for the EDR/SIEM Wazuh, specifically designed for lazy SOC analysts (^^). The goal is to provide a simplified and efficient interface that makes security operations more accessible and manageable.
This project is not meant to replace Kibana or Grafana (obviously), but is a way to show what a SIEM dashboard should look like from my perspective. 
Additionally, this dashboard adopts a group-based approach utilizing Wazuh groups to organize and manage data more effectively.

## Requirements
Tested on Debian 12 (Bookworm) with npm v18.19.0.
Works only on Wazuh > 4.8.0 (as the vulnerability section has been entirely recoded by the  Wazuh team)

## Installation
To install this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**: cd /opt/ && git clone https://github.com/A3gisS3c/YASD.git
2. **Navigate to the project directory**: cd YASD/
3. **Run the installation script**: chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh
