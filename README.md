## Important Note
This project is inactively maintained. This means that I merge pull request for bug fixes and issues that can be easily integrated but I don't have the time to add new features or extend existing ones.

# YASD
YASD serves as a user-friendly frontend for the EDR/SIEM Wazuh, specifically designed for lazy SOC analysts (^^). The goal is to provide a simplified and efficient interface that makes security operations more accessible and manageable.
This project is not meant to replace Kibana or Grafana (obviously), but is a way to show what a SIEM dashboard should look like from my perspective. 
Additionally, this dashboard adopts a group-based approach utilizing Wazuh groups to organize and manage data more effectively.
